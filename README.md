## Software requirements
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)

### 1. Clone this repository
Install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/COVIMUN_DT.git
```

### 2. Create an environment
Install [conda](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/COVIMUN_DT.git) to create a new python environment.

```
  conda env create -f covimun_ml_env.yml
  conda activate covimun_ml_env
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively:
- A virtual environment can be created using `virtualenv` 
- The `pip install -r requirements.txt` can be executed in your base environment given that python 3.9 is already installed in your system.

	abstract = {Interpretable risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients can aid clinicians to implement precision medicine. Here we trained a machine learning model to predict mortality within 12Â weeks of a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test. By leveraging data on 33,938 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in eastern Denmark, we considered 2723 variables extracted from electronic health records (EHR) including demographics, diagnoses, medications, laboratory test results and vital parameters. A discrete-time framework for survival modelling enabled us to predict personalized survival curves and explain individual risk factors. Performance on the test set was measured with a weighted concordance index of 0.95 and an area under the curve for precision-recall of 0.71. Age, sex, number of medications, previous hospitalizations and lymphocyte counts were identified as top mortality risk factors. Our explainable survival model developed on EHR data also revealed temporal dynamics of the 22 selected risk factors. Upon further validation, this model may allow direct reporting of personalized survival probabilities in routine care.},
